        "Around the late 1970s, lots of computers were being used for research. In their spare time, some of those were programmed to play games. War Games, a movie from 1983, used this idea for its central theme. The W.O.P.R. (War Operations Plan Response) was a big computer with a lot of flashing lights. When the protaganist of the movie, a teenager called David Lightman, accidentally connect to this computer he thinks it is owned by a computer games development company, and he finds this menu:\n",

        "For our course, we're not going to learn how to program a strategy game; intead, we're going to look at another genre popular around that time: the text based adventure game. In a text-based adventure, you move your character through a world by giving simple commands (e.g. go forward, turn left, turn right). You can't see anything, but instead are given a description of what is in front of you. Some objects you can interact with, others you cannot.\n",
